## 🎯 What is This Project?

We built a **house price prediction system** that estimates property prices based on 5 key features:
- Average area income
- House age
- Number of rooms
- Number of bedrooms
- Area population

**Why it matters:** Helps buyers, sellers, and real estate agents make better pricing decisions.

**Our approach:** Used Linear Regression on 5000+ property records and achieved 91.8% accuracy.

## 📈 Results

**Model Accuracy:** 91.8% (R² Score)

**What this means:**
- Our model can predict house prices with 91.8% accuracy
- Trained on 3500+ houses, tested on 1500+ houses
- Predictions are reliable for real-world use

**Key Findings:**
1. Income is the biggest factor affecting house prices
2. More rooms = Higher price
3. Older houses cost slightly less

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Try advanced algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Add more features (property type, amenities, location)
- Deploy online for public access
- Add price trend visualization
